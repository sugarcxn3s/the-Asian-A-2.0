				    <h2>STORY OF JOHN RIDLEHOOVER</h2>
				    <p>The personal story by John Ridlehoover is about his experience as a half-Filipino growing up in a small Southern town where he was the only Asian kid in every school before high school. He faced questions and teasing about his ethnicity which led to him isolating himself from the community. He first experienced depression in middle school and turned to drugs and alcohol to numb his feelings. However, this self-medicating triggered his anxiety and led to his worst depressive episode. He considered suicide before his girlfriend, now his wife, suggested he seek help from a therapist. Ridlehoover learned that he needed to find the right coping mechanisms for himself, and while the Asian-American experience with mental illness may be similar, everyone's story is unique. His family may not have understood his struggles at first, but they have always been supportive of him seeking help.</p>

				    <h2>STORY OF JACOB ZHENG</h2>
				    <p>Jacob Zheng shares a story about the intense pressure that Asian American high school students feel to gain admission to prestigious colleges. This pressure is exacerbated by the perception in Asian culture that success is heavily tied to academic achievement. Students who are unable to gain admission are often considered failures by their parents. Mental health is considered taboo in Asian American communities, and the competitive environment causes many young Asian Americans to compromise their mental health and wellbeing. The lack of education and understanding surrounding mental health and wellbeing prevents many Asian American students from seeking professional help. This isolation can lead to serious issues, such as suicide. Zheng concludes that it is time to educate both parents and children about mental health resources and open up the discussion of mental health in Asian American communities.</p>
