                <h1>WHAT ARE ANXIETY DISORDERS?</h1>
                <p>Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by excessive and persistent 
                    feelings of anxiety, worry, fear, and apprehension. These feelings can be intense, overwhelming, and interfere 
                    with daily activities and relationships.</p>
                <p>Some common types of anxiety disorders include:</p> 
                    <li class='info'>generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</li>
                    <li class='info'>panic disorder</li>
                    <li class='info'>social anxiety disorder (SAD)</li>
                    <li class='info'>specific phobias</li>
                    <li class='info'>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</li>
                <p>Each of these disorders has unique symptoms and may require different forms of treatment.</p>
                <p> Symptoms of anxiety disorders can include:</p> 
                    <li class='info'>restlessness</li>
                    <li class='info'>irritability</li>
                    <li class='info'>muscle tension</li>
                    <li class='info'>difficulty concentrating</li> 
                    <li class='info'>sleep disturbances</li>
                    <li class='info'>avoidance behaviors</li>
                <p>Anxiety disorders are typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, physical examination, and 
                    psychological assessment.</p>
                <p>Treatment for anxiety disorders may involve medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. Self-care strategies 
                    such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and stress management can also be helpful in managing anxiety symptoms. 
                    It's important to seek professional help if you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety as untreated anxiety disorders 
                    can lead to significant impairment in daily life.</p>
